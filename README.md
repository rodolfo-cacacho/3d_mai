# 3d object detection in manufacturing environment
## For Project module at Master artificial intelligence at THWS WÃ¼rzburg-Schweinfurt.

### Participants
Rodolfo Cacacho, Mohammad Moradi, Marius Oechslein

### Goal
Automatically detecting objects and subparts of the object in a manufacturing environment with a camera.

### Additional Requirements
- Model should be able to detect objects and subparts with a high accuracy and fast training and prediction time. 
- Training samples should be created from 3D CAD models of the objects.
- Users should be able to upload new CAD models, which should make the model be able to detect it. 
- Application should be available inside a software, by an API or inside a Jupyter Notebook.
