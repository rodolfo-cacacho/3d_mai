# Summary of the project
Here we want to summarize the work, to have all of the information needed for writing the paper in one place.

## Flowchart of the final architecture

## Results 

## Big problems we had to solve
### Simulation to reality (Sim2Real) 
We want to create the training images from 3D CAD files of the objects. Problem: The objects are perfect and don't have any defects, which is not the same when taking real images (which we want to classify at the end).

### From 3D objects to training images. Almost fully automated.
We want to automate as much as possible so the user has to do as little as possible. With the solution we came up with the user only has to label 125 images of assemblies manually (which takes around 30 minutes). Everything we were able to automate.
